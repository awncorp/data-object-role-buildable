NAME

    Data::Object::Role::Buildable

ABSTRACT

    Buildable Role for Perl 5

SYNOPSIS

      package Vehicle;
    
      use Moo;
    
      with 'Data::Object::Role::Buildable';
    
      has name => (
        is => 'rw'
      );
    
      1;

DESCRIPTION

    This package provides methods for hooking into object construction of
    the consuming class, e.g. handling single-arg object construction.

SCENARIOS

    This package supports the following scenarios:

 buildarg

      package Car;
    
      use Moo;
    
      extends 'Vehicle';
    
      sub build_arg {
        my ($class, $name) = @_;
    
        # do something with $name or $class ...
    
        return { name => $name };
      }
    
      package main;
    
      my $car = Car->new('tesla');

    This package supports handling a build_arg method, as a hook into
    object construction, which is called and passed a single argument if a
    single argument is passed to the constructor.

 buildargs

      package Sedan;
    
      use Moo;
    
      extends 'Car';
    
      sub build_args {
        my ($class, $args) = @_;
    
        # do something with $args or $class ...
    
        $args->{name} = ucfirst $args->{name};
    
        return $args;
      }
    
      package main;
    
      my $sedan = Sedan->new('tesla');

    This package supports handling a build_args method, as a hook into
    object construction, which is called and passed a hashref during object
    construction.

 buildself

      package Taxicab;
    
      use Moo;
    
      extends 'Sedan';
    
      sub build_self {
        my ($self, $args) = @_;
    
        # do something with $self or $args ...
    
        $args->{name} = 'Toyota';
    
        return;
      }
    
      package main;
    
      my $taxicab = Taxicab->new('tesla');

    This package supports handling a build_self method, as a hook into
    object construction, which is called and passed a hashref during object
    construction. Note: Manipulating the arguments doesn't effect object's
    construction or properties.
